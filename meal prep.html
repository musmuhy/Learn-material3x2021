<h3>There's a stereotype that women who consume protein supplements or lift weights
     will become "too muscular" or "manly" in appearance.<br> this is Truely false.<br>
     Protein powders provide a quick and easy way to increase protein intake, especially
     when whole food sources are not readily available or when you're in a hurry.
     basiclly its a short-cut to reach your daily protein intake.<br> ie 1.5 X Your body weight!
